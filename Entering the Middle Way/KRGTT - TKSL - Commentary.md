# Supplement to the Middle Way



# Chapter 1: The First Mind Generation

> In the Indian language: Madhyamakavataranama
> In Tibetan: dbu ma la ‘jug pa zhes bya ba
> [In English: Supplement to the “Middle Way”]

> Homage to the youthful Manjushri.

> Hearers and middling realizers of suchness are born from the Kings of Subduers.
> Buddhas are born from bodhisattvas.
> The mind of compassion, non-dual understanding,
> And the altruistic mind of enlightenment are the causes of children of conquerors.
>
> Mercy alone is seen as the seed of a conqueror’s rich harvest,
> As water for development, and as
> Ripening in a state of long enjoyment,
> Therefore at the start I praise compassion.
>
> Homage to that compassion for migrators who are
> Powerless like a bucket traveling in a well
> Through initially adhering to a self, an ‘I’,
> And then generating attachment for things, ‘This is mine.’ 
>
> [Homage to that compassion for] migrators seen as evanescent and
> Empty of inherent existence like a moon in rippling water.
> The mind of a child of a conqueror overpowered
> With compassion to liberate migrators,
>
> Dedicated with Samantabhadra’s aspirations,
> And abiding in joy is called the first.
> Then, having thus attained that mind
> He is called a ‘bodhisattva’.
>
> Born in the tathagata lineage
> He completely forsakes the three links.
> The bodhisattva attains an excellent joy
> And can vibrate a hundred world-systems. 
>
> Advancing from ground to ground he ascends,
> Now all his paths to bad migrations have ceased,
> All the levels of ordinary beings are ended.
> He is shown to be like the eighth superior.
>
> Even those abiding in the first mind of complete enlightenment
> Overcome those born from the speech of the Subduer Kings
> And solitary realizers through their own merit’s increase.
> On the Gone Afar he surpasses them with his intelligence.
>
> Then for him the first cause of perfect
> Enlightenment – giving – becomes surpassing.
> His devotion to giving even his own flesh
> Is reason for inferring the unimaginable. 
>
> All these beings want happiness, but human
> Happiness does not occur without resources.
> Knowing that resources arise from giving,
> The Subduer first discoursed on that. 
>
> Even for beings with little compassion,
> Brutal and intent on their own aim,
> Desired resources arise from giving,
> Causing extinguishment of suffering.
>
> Through giving even they will quickly attain
> A meeting with a superior being.
> Then they will cut the continuum of cyclic existence,
> Going to the peace caused by meeting a superior.
>
> Those bearing in mind a promise to help beings
> Attain happiness from giving before too long.
> For those merciful and those not so
> Only discourse on giving is therefore chief.
>
> Whereas when a conqueror child hears and thinks
> Of the word ‘give’, happiness arises,
> The subduers abiding in peace have no [such] happiness.
> What need is there to mention [the joy of] giving all?
>
> Through his own suffering in cutting and giving
> Away his body, he sees with knowledge others’ pain
> In hells and so forth, and strives quickly
> To eliminate their suffering. 
>
> Giving void of gift, giver, and receiver
> Is called a supramundane perfection.
> When attachment to these three is produced,
> It is called a mundane perfection.
>
> Abiding thus in the mind of a child of a conqueror
> Beautifying with light this excellent base,
> The Joyful [Ground] like a water crystal jewel
> Destroys and overcomes all heavy darkness.
>
> This is the first mind generation from Chandrakirti’s Supplement to the Middle Way.

# Chapter 2: The Second Mind Generation

> Because his ethics are sublime and have pure qualities,
> He forsakes the stains of faulty ethics even while he dreams.
> Because his movements of body, speech, and mind are pure,
> He accumulates all ten paths of excellent deeds.
>
> For him these ten paths of virtue,
> Perfected, are extremely pure.
> Like an autumn moon he is always pure,
> Beautified by them, serene and radiant.
>
> If he views his ethics as inherently pure,
> Then their purity will not be complete.
> Thus he always forsakes completely the wandering
> Of the dualistic intellect toward the three.
>
> The arising in bad migrations of resources from giving
> Is due to a being’s losing his legs of ethics.
> Having spent completely both principal and interest
> He will be without resources in the future.
>
> If when acting freely and living agreeably,
> He does not act to hold [himself back from falling down],
> He will fall into an abyss and lose control;
> How will he raise himself from there in the future?
>
> Thus the Conqueror, having discoursed on giving,
> Spoke upon its accompaniment by ethics.
> When virtues are nurtured on the field of ethics,
> The enjoyment of effects is unceasing.
>
> For common beings, those born from the word,
> Those set toward solitary enlightenment, and
> Conqueror children, a cause of definite goodness
> And high status is none other than proper ethics.
>
> Just as an ocean is incompatible with a corpse
> And just as prosperity is incompatible with calamity,
> So a great being subdued by ethics
> Does not wish to live with faulty ethics.
>
> ##### [2.9]
> 
> If there be any apprehension of the three –
> Forsaken by whom, what, and with regard to whom –
>Such ethics are described as being a mundane perfection.
> That empty of attachment to the three is supramundane.

- One way of dividing
  - In continuum of SB (i.e. Bodhisattva)
  - Not in continuum of SB (i.e. Buddha)
- Another way of dividing
  - Mundane
  - Supramundane
- The distinction being: whether the higher practice of perfection of ethics is qualified by wisdom realising emptiness the three spheres or not.
  - If inherent existence of any of the three spheres is grasped at, then it is mundane
    - This is due to someone unable to block the grasping at inherent existence
  - If inherent existence of the three spheres is not grasped at, then it is supramundane
- The three spheres:
  - Who: the person practicing ethics
  - What: the performance of practicing ethics
  - Whom: the person with respect to whom ethics is practiced



> ##### [2.10]
> 
> Like the light of an autumn moon, the Stainless
> Arising from the moon of a conqueror child,
>Though not worldly, the glory of the world,
> Removes the mental distress of migrators.

- Like the Autumn moon
  - In India, autumn is after the rainy season. 
  - The rain settles the dust, and the sky is clear. 
  - The clarity of the sky with the moon at night has a refreshing atmosphere.
  - This relaxing atmosphere soothes the minds of people
- Similarly
  - Practice of ethics soothes the mind of those around the practitioner
    - For example, someone who actively practices abandoning killing, stealing, etc. creates a soothing atmosphere around them
  - Practice of ethics not only protects your own peace of mind, but gives peace of mind to others too like the Autumn Moon

# Chapter 3: The Third Mind Generation

> Because the light of the fire wholly consuming
> The fuel of objects of knowledge arises,
> This third ground is called the Luminous, for a copper
> Splendor like the sun appears to the sugata child.
>
> Though another, unjustifiably disturbed
> By anger, cuts from his body flesh and bone
> Bit by bit for a long time, he generates
> Patience strongly toward the mutilator.
>
> Also through viewing these phenomena
> As like reflections – what bodhisattva
> Seeing selflessness is cut, by whom,
> Just how, and when – he will be patient.
>
> If you get angry with someone who has done you harm,
> Is that harm stopped because of your resentment toward him?
> Resentment thus is certainly senseless here
> And unfavorable for future lives.
>
> How could it be right for one, wishing to assert that
> He is finishing the effects of non-virtuous
> Actions done earlier, to sow the seeds of
> Suffering through harming and hating others?
>
> One moment of hating a conqueror child destroys
> The virtues arising from giving and ethics’
> Accumulated for a hundred eons.
> Thus there can be no [worse] sin than impatience.
>
> It creates an ugly form, leads to the unholy,
> And robs discrimination that knows right and wrong.
> Through impatience one is quickly cast into a bad migration.
> Patience creates qualities opposite to those 
>
> Explained above. Through patience comes beauty, dearness
> To the holy, skill in discriminating between
> The right and wrong, birth afterwards as a human
> Or god, and the extinguishment of non-virtues.
>
> Ordinary beings and conqueror children,
> Realizing the faults of anger and advantages of patience
> And forsaking impatience, should quickly and always observe
> The patience praised by superior beings. 
>
> Though dedicated to enlightenment of perfect buddhahood,
> [Patience] is mundane if one apprehends the three.
> [Patience] that does not involve such apprehension
> Buddha taught as a perfection supramundane. 
>
> On this ground the conqueror child has the concentrations and clairvoyances.
> Desire and hatred are extinguished.
> Always he is able to overcome
> The world’s lustful desires as well.
>
> The Sugata mainly praised these three practices
> Of giving, ethics, and patience for householders.
> These are also the collection of merit, the cause
> Of a buddha body the nature of which is form.
>
> Abiding in the sun which is the conqueror child,
> The Luminous first completely dispels his darkness,
> Then seeks to overcome the darkness of migrators.
> On this ground, though very sharp, he does not get angry.
>
> This is the third mind generation from Chandrakirti’s Supplement to the Middle Way.

# Chapter 4: The Fourth Mind Generation

> All attainments follow after effort,
> Cause of the two collections of merit
> And wisdom. The ground where effort
> Flames is the fourth, the Radiant.
>
> There for the sugata child an illumination arises
> Produced from a greater cultivation of the harmonies
> Of perfect enlightenment, surpassing the copper light.
> What is related to the view of a self is extinguished.
>
> This is the fourth mind generation from Chandrakirti’s Supplement to the Middle Way.
